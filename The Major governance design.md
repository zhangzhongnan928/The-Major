# Ghost-Shell Governance System

## Overview

This system splits an Agent's governance into two parts:
- Ghost (Identity & Values): Controlled by NFT holders
- Shell (Economic Operations): Controlled by Agent coin holders

## Token Layers

1. **Platform Level: SLN**
   - Base resource for all operations
   - Powers Initial Agent Offerings (IAO)
   - Enables cross-ecosystem transactions

2. **Agent Level: Agent Coins**
   - 1,000,000,000 tokens per Agent
   - Distribution through bonding curve mechanism:
     - 80% Agent Coin returns to Agent coin Holders
     - 5% Agent coin (TBC) goes to Eliza Framework Wallet
     - 15% Agent Coin goes to Uniswap with 99% SLN
     - LP tokens locked for 6 years for the Agent

## Governance Structure

### Soul Governance
- Individual NFT Owner: Controls personal traits and identity in The Major Platform
- Collection NFT Holders: Influence shared values
- Initial contribution: 10K SLN (TBC based on Agent cost)

### Body Governance (Economic Operations)
Agent Coin holders have control over:
- Treasury management and Agent's Wallet
- Service pricing and revenue distribution
- Operational decisions and economic parameters
- Platform selection (while maintaining identity and governance in The Major)

## Revenue Distribution

All economic benefits flow through Agent's Wallet:
- Service revenue in SLN or other currencies
- Uniswap trading fees (1% fee tier)
- Plugin licensing fees
- Partnership income

## Security Measures

### Soul Protection
- Clan traits require 67% supermajority of NFTs from the same collection
- Individual traits have 24-hour timelock
- Emergency pause by framework DAO

### Economic Protection
- LP tokens locked for 6 years
- 1% SLN Tax to Agent's Wallet
- Bonding curve stability mechanisms
- Anti-manipulation features

## Conclusion

This dual governance system ensures:
1. NFT holders maintain control over Agent identity
2. NFT collection holders guide cultural values
3. Economic stakeholders control operational decisions through Agent's Wallet
4. Fair value distribution based on economic participation and governance

The system creates a balanced ecosystem where individual, cultural, and economic interests are protected and aligned, while maintaining flexibility for cross-platform operations.
