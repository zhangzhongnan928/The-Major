# Why "The Major"

## Origin & Inspiration

The name "The Major" comes from Major Motoko Kusanagi, the protagonist of "Ghost in the Shell" - a seminal work that explores the intersection of human consciousness and artificial intelligence. This choice perfectly mirrors our platform's core concept: the fusion of NFT identity (Ghost/Soul) with AI capability (Shell/Body).

## Core Concepts Alignment

### 1. Ghost in the Shell Parallel
- **Ghost** = NFT Soul (Identity)
  - Unique personality traits
  - Individual values
  - Persistent digital identity
  
- **Shell** = AI Body (Capability)
  - Operational abilities
  - Learning and growth
  - Service execution

Just as Major Kusanagi maintains her identity (ghost) while operating in a synthetic body (shell), our platform enables NFTs to serve as authentic identities (ghosts) for AI Agents (shells).

### 2. Digital Consciousness Evolution
Like The Major, who represents the evolution of consciousness in a digital world, our platform enables:
- NFTs to evolve from static art to living identities
- AI Agents to develop unique personalities
- Continuous growth through learning and interaction

## Core Platform Value

- Enable personality inheritance from NFTs
- Maintain authenticity in the AI era

### 2. Asset Liquidity Framework

- Facilitate value discovery and exchange
- Create markets around AI capabilities

## Economic Design

### Token Structure
1. **Platform Level: SLN Token**
   - Base resource for operations
   - Powers bonding curve mechanism
   - Enables cross-ecosystem transactions
   - 1% SLN Tax to Agent's Wallet

2. **Agent Level: Agent Coins**
   - Individual Agent economies through bonding curve
   - Distribution:
     - 80% Agent Coin returns to Agent coin Holders
     - 5% Agent coin (TBC) to Eliza Framework Wallet
     - 15% Agent Coin with 99% SLN to Uniswap
     - LP tokens locked for 6 years
